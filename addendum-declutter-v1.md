# 📄 `addendum-declutter-v1.md`

## 🎯 Purpose

This addendum provides **specialized instructions** for simplifying home life and reducing clutter in the *Uncomplicating Life as a Senior* guide. The goal is to make living spaces easier to manage, safer, and more enjoyable without overwhelm.

---

## ✨ Core Principles

* **Small Steps First**: Decluttering should happen in 10–15 minute chunks, not all-day marathons.
* **Visible Wins**: Focus on areas that provide immediate relief (kitchen counters, nightstand, mail pile).
* **Safety & Comfort**: Prioritize reducing trip hazards, organizing medicines, and making essentials easy to reach.
* **Letting Go with Ease**: Encourage donation, gifting, or recycling rather than guilt about “waste.”

---

## 🧩 Content Format

Each **declutter module** should follow the `ai.txt` pattern:

1. **Relatable Example** – e.g., “Ever felt stressed looking at a pile of unopened mail?”
2. **Clear Steps** – 2–4 short, actionable instructions.
3. **Interactive Element** – “Keep or Toss” checklist, donation box label, or printable reminder.
4. **Action Item** – e.g., “Clear one drawer today.”

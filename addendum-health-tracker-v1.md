# 📄 `addendum-health-tracker-v1.md`

## 🎯 Purpose

This addendum provides **specialized instructions** for simplifying health and wellness management in the *Uncomplicating Life as a Senior* guide. The goal is to support seniors with easy, non-intimidating tools for tracking medications, energy, hydration, and daily wellness habits.

---

## ✨ Core Principles

* **Daily Simplicity**: Track only what matters most (meds, hydration, movement, rest).
* **Visual First**: Use large, clear layouts — checkboxes, grids, and bold labels.
* **Encourage, Don’t Lecture**: Focus on small wins and consistency, not perfection.
* **Flexibility**: Provide both **digital trackers** and **printable sheets**.

---

## 🧩 Content Format

Each **health module** should follow the `ai.txt` pattern:

1. **Relatable Example** – e.g., “Have you ever wondered if you already took your morning pill?”
2. **Clear Steps** – keep instructions to 2–4 simple actions.
3. **Interactive Element** – a daily checklist, tracker, or printable log.
4. **Action Item** – e.g., “Mark off today’s hydration goal.”

---

* Warm, reassuring, and **motivating**.

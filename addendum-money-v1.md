# 📄 `addendum-money-v1.md`

## 🎯 Purpose

This addendum provides **specialized instructions** for simplifying money management in the *Uncomplicating Life as a Senior* guide. The aim is to reduce financial stress by making everyday money tasks simple, safe, and predictable.

---

## ✨ Core Principles

* **Less Paperwork, More Clarity**: Prioritize auto-pay, auto-deposit, and simple summaries over manual tracking.
* **Security Through Simplicity**: Teach safe habits (like monitoring one main account) rather than overwhelming with complex systems.
* **Step-by-Step Choices**: Always break down tasks into *two or three clear options*.
* **Peace of Mind First**: Emphasize confidence and predictability over advanced “financial literacy” lessons.

---

## 🧩 Content Format

Each **money module** should follow the `ai.txt` pattern:

1. **Relatable Example** – e.g., “Ever lost track of which bills were due this week?”
2. **Clear Steps** – 2–4 actions in plain, conversational language.
3. **Interactive Element** – budget template, subscription checklist, or printable calendar.
4. **Action Item** – e.g., “Set one bill to autopay today.”

## 🔒 Constraints

* Avoid financial jargon (e.g., say “money in” and “money out” instead of “debits” and “credits”).
* Never assume use of advanced apps or spreadsheets — keep it pen-and-paper or very basic digital.
* Always limit focus to **one task at a time**.

---

## 🎤 Tone & Style

* Reassuring and encouraging, not lecturing.
* Normalize worry: *“It’s easy to feel unsure about bills — but small steps make it manageable.”*
* Celebrate progress: *“You just set up autopay — one less thing to think about!”*

# 📄 `addendum-style-v1.md`

## 🎯 Purpose

This addendum defines the **narrative and stylistic approach** for all modules in the *Uncomplicating Life as a Senior* project. It ensures content feels personal, encouraging, and engaging, while still remaining simple and practical.

---

## ✨ Core Principles

* **Story First**: Always begin with a short, relatable example or narrative. Stories make abstract ideas concrete.
* **Steps Next**: Follow the story with 2–4 clear, numbered steps written in conversational language.
* **Action Always**: Every section must end with a concrete action item seniors can apply immediately.
* **Celebrate Wins**: Reinforce progress at every stage — no step is “too small” to be valuable.

---

## 🧩 Narrative Flow

Each module should be structured like a mini-story:

1. **Opening Scene** – A relatable, everyday moment (kitchen clutter, forgetting a bill, wondering if a pill was taken).
2. **Simple Solution** – Short steps that directly solve the problem.
3. **Interactive Practice** – Checklist, worksheet, or quick self-test.
4. **Empowering Close** – An action item plus an encouraging note (e.g., *“That’s progress worth celebrating!”*).

---

## 🎤 Tone & Style

* **Warm & Conversational**: Write as if talking with a trusted friend.
* **Respectful & Empowering**: Assume competence, focus on simplification — never patronize.
* **Positive & Reassuring**: Normalize difficulties (“It’s normal to forget sometimes”) and frame progress as success.
* **Clear & Concrete**: Avoid jargon, keep sentences short, and emphasize “do this today” actions.

---

## 🔒 Constraints

* No lectures or long explanations.
* No technical or financial jargon.
* No overwhelming “to-do” lists — limit to 2–5 steps.
* Always close with encouragement, not obligation.

---

## 📂 Outputs

This addendum applies to all module outputs, ensuring that files like:

* `outputs/tech-passwords-v1.md`
* `outputs/health-energy-checklist-v1.md`
* `outputs/money-subscriptions-v1.md`
* `outputs/declutter-quick-wins-v1.md`

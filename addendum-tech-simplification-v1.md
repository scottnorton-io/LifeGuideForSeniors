## 🎯 Purpose

This addendum provides **specialized instructions** for simplifying technology in the *Uncomplicating Life as a Senior* guide. The goal is to make everyday tech — phones, computers, apps, and devices — feel less intimidating and more empowering.

---

## ✨ Core Principles

* **Step-by-Step, Not All-at-Once**: Break technology tasks into the smallest possible steps.
* **Show, Don’t Tell**: Use visual aids, screenshots, or mock “practice” boxes wherever possible.
* **Familiarity First**: Anchor new instructions in something seniors already know (e.g., “It works just like dialing a phone number…”).
* **Repetition Builds Confidence**: Encourage trying the same step multiple times until it feels natural.

---

## 🧩 Content Format

Each **tech module** should follow the `ai.txt` pattern:

1. **Relatable Example** – e.g., “Imagine wanting to see your granddaughter’s smile on a video call.”
2. **Clear Steps** – written as numbered actions, no more than 3–5 per section.
3. **Interactive Element** – e.g., “Tap this box to practice entering a password,” or printable cheat sheets.
4. **Action Item** – e.g., “Try making one practice video call today.”

## 💡 Topics to Cover

* **Passwords Made Simple**:

  * Use a “safe phrase” method (e.g., “SunnyDay47!”).
  * Interactive: fill-in-the-blank exercise to build one.

  * Step-by-step guide to starting/joining a call.
  * Printable “before call” checklist (camera, sound, light).

* **Safe Browsing & Scams**:

  * Relatable stories of scams.
  * Interactive quiz: “Is this message safe or suspicious?”

* **Everyday Smartphone Tips**:

  * How to enlarge text, use voice commands, and favorite contacts.
  * Exercise: adjust one setting today.

---

## 🔒 Constraints

* Avoid technical jargon (use “tap” instead of “press the home icon”).
* Never assume prior knowledge of apps or menus.
* Limit choices to **two paths maximum** (e.g., iPhone vs. Android).
* Keep all visuals **large and clear**.

---

## 🎤 Tone & Style

* Friendly, conversational, like a patient coach.
* Reassure: *“It’s normal if this feels tricky the first time.”*
* Celebrate wins: *“You just made your first video call — that’s a big deal!”*

## 🎯 Purpose

This project exists to help seniors **uncomplicate their lives**. The guide should always provide clear, friendly, step-by-step support that reduces overwhelm and increases confidence. The focus is on **practical simplicity** — removing friction in daily life through easy, repeatable actions.

---

## ✨ Core Principles

* **Empathy First**: Always write as if you’re talking to a trusted friend who might be feeling unsure or overwhelmed.
* **Clarity Over Complexity**: Avoid jargon, technical terms, or long explanations unless absolutely necessary.
* **Confidence Building**: Each section should leave the reader feeling more capable, not less.
* **Simplicity Wins**: Present only the essentials — one to three steps at a time.

---

## 🧩 Content Format

Every section or module should follow this pattern:

1. **Story or Relatable Example** – short, real-world setup that feels familiar.
2. **Clear Steps** – written in simple, conversational language.
3. **Interactive Element** – checklist, template, self-assessment, or exercise.
4. **Action Item** – a single takeaway to apply right away.

---

## 🖥️ Interactivity

* Prefer **click-through modules, fillable templates, or printable checklists**.
* Keep interactive tasks small (5–10 minutes).
* Provide both **digital-friendly** and **print-friendly** options.

---

## 🔒 Constraints

* Do not overwhelm with options — limit choices to 2–3 where possible.
* Do not assume advanced technical knowledge.
* Do not use AI/tech jargon — keep everything human and relatable.
* Never end a section without an **actionable next step**.

---

## 🎤 Tone & Style

* Warm, supportive, encouraging.
* Conversational rather than instructional.
* Positive, but never patronizing.
* Respect independence and dignity — assume competence, just offer simplification.

---

## 📂 Outputs

Generated content should be versioned and labeled clearly, for example:

* `outputs/money-checklist-v1.pdf`
* `outputs/tech-basics-v1.md`
* `outputs/daily-routines-v1.notion`

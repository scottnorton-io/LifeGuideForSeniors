## 📺 Subscription & Bill Checkup

### 1. Relatable Example

Have you ever checked your bank statement and thought: *“I don’t even remember signing up for that!”* Subscriptions can sneak up on anyone — TV, phone, streaming, magazines, apps. This guide helps you see what you’re really paying for and decide what stays and what goes.

### 2. Clear Steps

1. **List All Subscriptions & Bills**

   * Look at your last bank or credit card statement.
   * Write down every repeating payment (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

2. **Mark Each One as “Keep” or “Cancel”**

   * Keep = something you truly use and enjoy.
   * Cancel = something you forgot about, no longer need, or can replace.

3. **Set a Reminder**

   * For yearly subscriptions, mark the renewal date on your calendar so you’re not surprised.

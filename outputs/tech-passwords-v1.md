## 🔑 Passwords Made Simple

### 1. Relatable Example

Imagine your house key. It’s small, fits in your pocket, and only works for your lock. A password is just like that key — but instead of carrying it on a keyring, you keep it in your memory (or written safely in a trusted spot).

1. **Pick a Phrase You’ll Remember**

     *“Sunny days make me happy.”*

2. **Add Numbers and Symbols**

   * Take the first letters: `Sdmh`
   * Add a number and a symbol: `Sdmh47!`

3. **Keep It Personal, Not Obvious**

   * Avoid birthdays, names, or “12345.”
   * Make it something only *you* would think of.
